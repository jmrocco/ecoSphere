EcoSphere encourages people to recycle through fun, creative animations and data collecting techniques. 

Essentially, users are thrown into a virtual environment that is polluted, and as the user tracks their recycling progress, their virtual environment brightens. 

Using an engaging method, recycling becomes fun and rewarding. Aimed at younger users as an educational tool to learning about the environment and recycling. 

Users are able to see the impact they have on the environment through their digital atmosphere.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for ecoSphere came from a driving passion to increase recycling among our communities coupled with a love for social media applications like SnapChat. We wanted to create an application that would get people excited about recycling.

## What It Does
EcoSphere, an android application, encourages people to recycle through fun, creative animations and data collecting techniques. Essentially, users are thrown into a virtual environment that is polluted, and as users report to the application that they have recycled, the environment brightens. In other words, users can see this virtual environment because cleansed as they continue to report that they have recycled. The impact that recycling has isn't always evident; ecoSphere allows users In a creative way to see the change they are making.

## How We Built It
This application was built primarily with Corona using a language called Lua, but the graphics were done in Adobe Photoshop.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The most difficult challenge we ran into was the time constraint. This was our first time developing an android application, and unfortunately, this led to us not having time to successfully incorporate Snapkit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of the fact that we taught ourselves the basics of app development. We created a fully functional game that demonstrates the message we wanted to convey.

## What's next for ecoSphere
We would like to incorporate a SnapKit function that allows users to unlock SnapChat filters as they recycle and be able to compare recycling scores against friends. Additionally, a future update will integrate a visual recognition system that can identify what items are being recycled and assign different amounts of points depending on the type of item.

## How to Download

This application was written and tested in [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/) using Lua. 

NOTE: Please make sure to change the view to IPhoneX, resolution is based on that format.
