# ecoSphere

**Created by: James Bates, Caleb Brett and Juliette Rocco for Ecoding Hacks 2019.**


EcoSphere encourages people to recycle through fun, creative animations and data collecting techniques. 

Essentially, users are thrown into a virtual environment that is polluted, and as the user tracks their recycling progress, their virtual environment brightens. 

Using an engaging method, recycling becomes fun and rewarding. Aimed at younger users as an educational tool to learning about the environment and recycling. 

Users are able to see the impact they have on the environment through their digital atmosphere.
